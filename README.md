## Development

This repo is splited into two workspaces.

The main workspace is at [packages/gqlpen-app](https://github.com/azmy60/gqlpen/tree/main/packages/gqlpen-app). The web extension (for chrome) is at [packages/gqlpen-web-ext](https://github.com/azmy60/gqlpen/tree/main/packages/gqlpen-web-ext).

In the future, I want to make a proxy server to address the CORS issue. This can be easily done with express server, but I'm thinking of using rust, but I'm still not good at it D:
